I was born in Connecticut and like Keith, started programming for the first time <br>
my freshman year. I am a senior now and have taken many courses, like Web and Database <br>
development, Software Design, System Administration, Object Oriented Programming, <br>
Human Computer Interaction, and many more. Each of these classes have helped me  <br>
advance in my degree and be a part of two teams. One team working with an API and <br>
creating a database, the other more focused on the user computer interaction. This <br>
project with make this my third team and project to work with.<br>
