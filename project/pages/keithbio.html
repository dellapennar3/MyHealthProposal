  Keith was born and raised in Southern California.<br>

  Since then, he has continued to improve his programming abilities and understanding of computers through much course <br>
  work throughout the years. He has experience with object oriented programming, functional program, network programming,<br>
  git and git hub, databases, web development, linux OS, multiple programming languages <br>
  (including Java and PHP YUCK!), distributed systems, and plenty of group projects. CSS is his kryptonite.<br> <br>
